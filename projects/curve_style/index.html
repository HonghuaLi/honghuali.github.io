	<h2> Abstract </h2>
	<p>  
	The word "style" can be interpreted in so many different ways in so many different contexts. To provide a general
	analysis and understanding of styles is a highly challenging problem. We pose the open question "how to extract
	styles from geometric shapes?" and address one instance of the problem. Specifically, we present an unsupervised
	algorithm for identifying curve styles in a set of shapes. In our setting, a curve style is explicitly represented by a
	mode of curve features appearing along the 2D silhouettes of the shapes in the set. Unlike previous attempts, we
	do not rely on any preconceived conceptual characterizations, e.g., via specific shape descriptors, to define what
	is or is not a style.
